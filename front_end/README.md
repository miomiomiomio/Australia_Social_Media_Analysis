After the user opens the webpage, there are two buttons in the middle of the webpage, corresponding to two scenarios, one of which is related to lust and the other is related to gluttony. When the user clicks the button, the webpage will jump to Google Maps. The map will automatically load the data we downloaded from AURIN and the data we got after analyzing Twitter. When the user stops the mouse in a certain area on the map, the relevant data of the area is displayed. There is a checkbox at the bottom of the map. When the user selects an item, the user can see the comparison between the data among all the areas from the map. The user can select up to two items, and the relationship between the two items can be seen on the map.
